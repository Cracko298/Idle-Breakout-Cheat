If you're choosing this you should know how to edit and use locale cache for chrome. (I'm not doing a tutorial here).

This is the custom cache. Change to your liking. Although it MAY break or crash the website. So it's best to know what you're doing.

And make sure you're pasting or editing inside the locale storage name. Should be called: breakout.924370207.save.dat

Or something around that name.
